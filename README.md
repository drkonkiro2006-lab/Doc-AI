## 🚀 AI Stack: Google Gemini × Weights & Biases (W&B Weave)

### 🔹 Why Google Gemini?
**Google Gemini** is used as the core intelligence engine of this project. It powers all medical image understanding, OCR, and reasoning tasks.

**Where it is used:**
- Blood report OCR and biomarker extraction  
- Medical image analysis (eye, skin, X-ray, MRI)
- Structured clinical summaries and preventive insights  

**Why Gemini was chosen:**
- 🧠 Strong multimodal capabilities (image + text reasoning)
- ⚡ Fast and reliable inference for real-time analysis
- 📄 Accurate OCR and medical-context understanding
- 🔐 Secure backend-only usage (API keys never exposed to frontend)

Gemini enables the system to transform raw medical reports into **clear, patient-friendly insights**.

### 🔹 Why Weights & Biases (W&B Weave)?
**W&B Weave** is used to bring **traceability, transparency, and evaluation** to all AI-powered decisions in the system.

**Where it is used:**
- Tracing every Gemini inference call
- Logging inputs (images), outputs (structured JSON), and latency
- Debugging failed or incorrect AI predictions
- Laying the foundation for future model evaluation and audits

**Why W&B Weave was chosen:**
- 🧵 End-to-end AI traceability (every request is trackable)
- 🧪 Helps debug and compare AI behavior across runs
- 📊 Enables evaluation-ready, reproducible AI pipelines
- 🏆 Hackathon-grade best practice for responsible AI systems

By combining **Gemini for intelligence** and **W&B Weave for observability**, the project ensures that AI decisions are not only powerful, but also **auditable, explainable, and production-ready**.
